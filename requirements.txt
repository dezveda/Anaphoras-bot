# Technical Analysis Library
TA-Lib # IMPORTANT for Windows: Installation can be tricky.
       # Requires the TA-Lib C library to be installed.
       # If 'pip install TA-Lib' fails, you might need to:
       # 1. Download a pre-compiled .whl file for your Python version and Windows architecture
       #    (e.g., from Christoph Gohlke's Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages:
       #     https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib)
       #    and then 'pip install TA_Lib-XYZ-cpXY-cpXYm-win_amd64.whl'.
       # 2. Or, install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools and ensure the TA-Lib C library
       #    is correctly installed and discoverable by the compiler.
       #    (Download C library from https://ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html and follow instructions)
       # 3. Alternatively, consider using Conda:
       #    'conda install -c conda-forge libta-lib'
       #    'conda install -c conda-forge ta-lib'

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)
PySide6 # For the GUI components (alternative to PyQt5, more liberal license)
pyqtgraph>=0.12 # For charting capabilities

# Other useful utilities
# (Add any other general-purpose libraries here as needed)
# Example: scikit-learn (if machine learning based strategies are explored later)
# Example: matplotlib (for plotting, if GUI doesn't cover all needs or for backtesting reports)
# Example: jupyter (for research and strategy development)
